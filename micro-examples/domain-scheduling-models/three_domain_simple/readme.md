# Three Domain Model - Simple

These artifacts support the design of HAMR code generation for [SeL4 Microkit](https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/microkit/).  
In particular, the artifacts aim to illustrate..
* prototyping approaches for integrating the seL4 domain scheduler in microKit to support static scheduling with strong temporal partitioning,
* prototyping HAMR generation of the [Microkit system description files](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/blob/main/docs/manual.md#system-description-file-sysdesc) from AADL and SysMLv2 architecture files
* prototyping of HAMR generation of C code for Microkit-based applications -- including header files and skeletons for protection domain entry points aligned with system description specification.

These artifacts illustrate the following newly added HAMR capabilities
* front-end processing of an [AADL model]((aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl)) with model annotations derived from the previous DARPA case program
* auto-generation of a [Microkit system description](microkit_initial/microkit.system) specification (which is used by the Microkit infrastructure to configure the seL4 kernel).  Specifically, the kernel is configured into partitions (Microkit protection domains) corresponding to AADL `process` components declared in the AADL model.  In addition, shared memory regions are configured to support inter-partition communication, as indicated by component data ports and connections specified in the AADL model.
* auto-generation of a [skeleton Microkit project](https://github.com/loonwerks/INSPECTA-models/tree/main/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/microkit_initial) including skeletons for protection domain application code for each of the `process` components declared in the AADL system.   The developer uses C development tools to complete the application code (as illustrated by a separated repo folder showing the skeleton project instantiated to a [completed system](https://github.com/loonwerks/INSPECTA-models/tree/main/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/microkit)).   The auto-generated project also includes makefiles, etc. to do a system build.  See the build instructions below.
* auto-generation of "infrastructure" protection domains and temporal control aspects achieved via Microkit notifications that are used to realize a static scheduling regime. 
* auto-generation of initial audit artifacts intended to support traceability/assurance of seL4 kernel configuration to models.  This is currently represented by a simple auto-generated dot diagram of [Microkernel protection domains and communication topology](microkit_initial/microkit.dot).

Note that the artifacts above can also be generated by a SysMLv2 model corresponding to the AADL model.  HAMR supports that currently, but we haven't yet added a SysMLv2 model into this repo.

These aritifacts *do not* illustrate a fully realized run-time infrastructure providing AADL semantics for threading and port communication.  Such additional runtime functionality will be realized in a later prototyping step to be carried out after the basic Microkit artifacts illustrated here have been vetted.

These artifacts *do not* illustrate Rust code generation or development support.   Those features will be added later.

The rough development plan for adding these features is as follows:
* add basic support for virtual machines with Microkit protection domains (by mid-October)
* add support for AADL event and event data ports representations and sporadic threads in the Microkit skeleton (mid-October)
* add AADL run-time code (C-based) (end of October)
* add Microkit Rust-based project skeleton (mid November)
* add AADL run-time code (Rust-based) (end of January 2025)


## AADL Architecture

AADL includes both a graphical and textual representation of models.

The graphical representation of the system (as generated by the OSATE AADL IDE) is shown below.
![arch](aadl/diagrams/arch.png)

The graphical representation above is auto-generated from [AADL Model textual representation](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl)

This system including three application components.  Each component is represented in AADL as a `thread` component within a `process` component.  This follows the AADL modeling semantics in which an AADL `process` represents a protected address space and an AADL `thread` represents a unit of schedulability.   The `process` notion aligns with a Microkit protection domain and the `thread` notion aligns with static-scheduled execution of code within a Microkit protection domain.

AADL unidirection data ports (indicated by solid triangle icons) are used in this example to specify communication between application components.   A port declaration is part of a component's public interface and AADL connections (represented by lines between ports) represent the actual port-to-port directional communication.

In this example, [32 bit signed integers are used as the data type](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl#L17) for all ports.  HAMR translates those to C's [int32_t](microkit_initial/components/p1_t1/src/p1_t1.c#10).

[AADL Model (textual representation)](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl)

### AADL Example Component

The AADL specification for `T2` is [here](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl#L57-L69).  It includes AADL properties that influence the scheduling semantics for the component.  Specifically, the component is declared to be periodic thread with a period of 1000ms and a WCET of 100ms (the `Compute_Execution_Time` property) -- the `Compute_Execution_Time` property value becomes the domain schedule slot duration for `T2`'s slot in the domain schedule.

The thread interface includes an input port named `read_port` and an output port named `write_port`.

## Relevant Microkit Artifacts

HAMR generates a Microkit project skeleton based on the supplied AADL/SysMLv2 model.  This skeleton is executable from the outset, enabling developers to start with a running system (agile approach) and incrementally build out functionality.

This repo provides two folders that illustrate the [initial project skeleton](microkit_initial) and then the [completed system with user supplied behavior code](microkit). 

Each AADL thread/process component is represented by several Microkit level artifacts:
* "infrastructure code" that includes
  - Microkit protection domain entry points (e.g., for `init` and then for `notification`, which is used to realize the scheduling approach, i.e., the controlled release of the application code for execution)
  - APIs for reading each input port (name and type specific corresponding to the AADL-level port name and declared port type)
  - APIs for writing each output port (name and type specific corresponding to the AADL-level port name and declared port type)
* "application code" that includes AADL-standard entry points (e.g., the `initialize` entry point and `time-triggered` entry point).

Thus, the infrastructure code realizes an adapter from Microkit compliant entry points to AADL-compliant entry points.  
* Later on, when HAMR adds auto-generated/libraries for AADL run-time compliant semantics, that code will be called within the infrastructure code.
* Later on, when contracts are auto-generated from GUMBO contracts in AADL models, those contracts will be placed (with Rust method signatures, etc.) in the "application code".   Verus will then be used to verify that user-supplied Rust code conforms to contracts.

Links are provided below to both infrastructure and application aspects of each component.  For the application aspects, links are provided to both the initial auto-generated the skeleton and then completed version with the user-supplied application code.

## Microkit Architecture

HAMR auto-generates a graphical depiction of the Microkit-level protection domain and communication architecture using dot.   The dot source is [here](microkit_initial/microkit.dot), and the image below is rendered from the dot source. 

![microkit.png](microkit/microkit.dot.png)

As HAMR development progress, additional artifacts will be generated by auditable documents establishing traceability between the Microkit/seL4 level artifacts and AADL/SysMLv2 system models.

## Realization of Static Scheduling 

The application developer's view of scheduling (aligning with the AADL semantics for thread dispatching and execution) is that the application code in the `timetriggered` method for each periodic thread component (e.g., for [component T2](microkit/components/p2_t2/src/p2_t2_user.c#L8-L26)) is released for execution at the beginning of its static schedule slot, and it executes (typically to completion).  If there is any remaining time within the slot after execution of the time-triggered method, no further execution occurs for the thread's application code until the thread appears again in the static schedule.

Microkit does not include scheduling abstractions to achieve this execution pattern directly.   To realize the semantics described above, HAMR generates additional notifications, protection domains, and infrastructure code.   The key aspects are as follows..
*  HAMR auto-generates a [static schedule](microkit_initial/microkit.system#L3-L11) using seL4 domain schedule declaration in the Microkit system description file.  This information is based on the AADL process/thread properties associating an application component with a scheduling domain and giving the WCET for a component's AADL *Compute* entry point.  The auto-generated schedule can be subsequently hand-modified by the developer if desired.  Later on in the program, we hope to apply scheduling tools to the AADL/SysMLv2 models to help engineers develop and reason about scheduling aspects.
* The [infrastructure code for each component](microkit/components/p2_t2/src/p2_t2.c#L29-L35) subscribes to a notification whose purpose is to trigger release of the application code held in the component's `timetriggered` method
* An additional infrastructure `pacer` protection domain ([system description](microkit_initial/microkit.system#L38-L40), [implementation](microkit_initial/components/pacer/src/pacer.c#L10-L22) is introduced to send notifications to each application component to release their application code for execution.  The pacer runs in a distinct scheduling domain (Domain 1).  

Given the above artifacts there are several possible strategies to realize desired behavior.  In the latest iteration of HAMR prototyping, based on feedback from UNSW, the following strategy is implemented...
* a parent "monitor" protection domain ([system description](microkit_initial/microkit.system#L21-L28), [implementation](microkit_initial/components/p2_t2/src/p2_t2_MON.c)) is introduced to accompany each application component's protection domain to manage interactions with the pacer component (and in the future, to manage error conditions associated with the application component code).
* during seL4 initialization (in each monitor's seL4 `init` entry point), the component monitor sends a notification to the pacer indicating that it's child's application code is available for scheduling.
* when the pacer component receives a notification from a monitor component, it [echos the notification back to the monitor](microkit_initial/components/pacer/src/pacer.c#L10-L22) to enable the release of the component's application code.
* When a component monitor receives a notification from the pacer, it [does the following](microkit_initial/components/p2_t2/src/p2_t2_MON.c#L11-L21) 
  - sends a separate notification to the child protection domain to enable the execution of the component's application code `timetriggered` method, 
  - and then sends a notification back to the pacer indicating that the component application code has been release and is now available for release again whenever it is encountered in a subsequent scheduling slot. 

The above notification strategy realizes the desired semantics because sending of notifications occurs along with the execution of the sending protection domain, while handling of notifications occurs when the receiving protection domain appears in the domain schedule.  To achieve the proper behavior, the pacer's scheduling domain must be interleaved between the domains of each of the application components in the domain schedule.

The above strategy with monitors also 
* enables an application component to appear/execute more than once in the "major frame" associated with a single cycle of the domain schedule.
* provides a basis for future implementation of error handling and recovery of component application code (e.g., based on AADL's notification of `recovery` entry point).


## Installation


1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

1. Clone this repo and cd into it

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/loonwerks/INSPECTA-models.git
   cd INSPECTA-models
   ```

1. *OPTIONAL*

    If you want to rerun codegen then you will need to install Sireum
    and OSATE.  You can do this inside or outside of the container that you'll pull in the next section (the latter is probably preferable as you could then use Sireum outside of the container).

    Copy/paste the following to install Sireum
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sireum/kekinian.git
    ```

    This installs/builds Sireum from source rather than via a binary distribution (which is probably the prefered method for PROVERS).  

    Now set ``SIREUM_HOME`` to point to where you cloned kekinian and add ``$SIREUM_HOME/bin`` to your path.  E.g. for bash

    ```
    echo "export SIREUM_HOME=$(pwd)/kekinian" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    echo "export PATH=\$SIREUM_HOME/bin:\$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    source $HOME/.bashrc
    ```

    To update Sireum in the future do the following
    ```
    cd $SIREUM_HOME
    git pull --rec
    bin/build.cmd
    ```

    Run the following to install IVE and CodeIVE which provide IDE support for Slang and SysMLv2 respectively.
    ```
    sireum setup ive
    sireum setup vscode
    ```

    Run the following to install OSATE and the Sireum plugins which provides IDE and codegen support for AADL. This will install OSATE into your current directory (or wherever as indicated via the ``-o`` option).  For Windows/Linux 
    ```
    sireum hamr phantom -u -v -o $(pwd)/osate
    ```

    or for Mac copy/paste
    ```
    sireum hamr phantom -u -v -o $(pwd)/osate.app
    ```

    Now set ``OSATE_HOME`` to point to where you installed Osate

    ```
    echo "export OSATE_HOME=$(pwd)/osate" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    source $HOME/.bashrc
    ```

## Codegen

1. *OPTIONAL* Rerun codegen targetting Microkit
   
    Launch the Slash script [aadl/bin/run-hamr.cmd](aadl/bin/run-hamr.cmd) from the command line.  This runs codegen on [top.impl](aadl/test_data_port_periodic_three_domains.aadl#L138) via OSATE and targets the Microkit platform.

   ```
   micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/aadl/bin/run-hamr.cmd
   ```

   Run the following to do an appraisal on the results (appraising will fail if any changes are made to the AADL files or the microkit.system file)

   ```
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/microkit/provers/INSPECTA-models jasonbelt/microkit_domain_scheduling \
      bash -ci "\$HOME/provers/INSPECTA-models/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/attestation/run-attestation.cmd aadl"
   ```   

1. Build and simulate the seL4 Microkit image

    Run the following from this repository's root directory.  The docker image ``jasonbelt/microkit_domain_scheduling`` contains customized versions of Microkit and seL4 that support domain scheduling. They were built off the following pull requests

   - [microkit #175](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/pull/175)
   - [seL4 #1308](https://github.com/seL4/seL4/pull/1308)

   ```
    docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/microkit/inspecta-models jasonbelt/microkit_domain_scheduling \
      bash -ci "cd \$HOME/inspecta-models/micro-examples/domain-scheduling-models/three_domain_simple/microkit \
                && make qemu"
    ```

    You should get output similar to

    ```
